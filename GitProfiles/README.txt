Known issues:
The image resizes when the keyboard pops up.
The error received with invalid inputs is always "Unable to connect to the server."

Future possible enhancements:
Replace the IntentService structure with a worker thread struture handled by a Service. This way, it is possible to download multiple things at
	once rather than only a chunk at a time.
Improve the active events to make more sense and show more data.
